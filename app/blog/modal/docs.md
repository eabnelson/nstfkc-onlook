# Outline

## Intro
A Modal is a tool to acquire user focus and direct it a narrower space to make desired action easier to perform for the user.

## The Problem
When modals suddenly appear and disappear, it makes it harder for user to reason about what is really going on. User needs visual feedback from the UI to acknowledge if they performed the action successfully or not.

Usually, opening a modal is not a problem because animating a mounting element is easy to do with CSS animations. It will trigger as soon as the element is being added to the DOM. The exit animations are often neglected because it is harder to implement. The elements need to be removed from the DOM after the animations are finished. And it is not possible to know when is a CSS animation is finished in javascript.


## The solution

The solution is to use a javascript based animation library like framer motion. Framer motion provides an api to subscribe to an animation value so you can discard your elements.
